  include Comparable
  #The Comparable mixin is used by classes whose objects may be ordered.
  #The class must define the <=> operator, which compares the receiver
  #against another object, returning -1, 0, or +1 depending on whether
  #the receiver is less than, equal to, or greater than the other object.
  #If the other object is not comparable then the <=> operator should return nil.
  #Comparable uses <=> to implement the conventional comparison operators
  #(<, <=, ==, >=, and >) and the method between?.
